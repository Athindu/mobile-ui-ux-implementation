## Lkiea : Your Neighbourhood Online Marketplace


Lkiea serves as a neighbourhood online marketplace, where people come together to make, sell, buy, and collect DIY items. The main concept of the Lkiea is to connect people/neighbours in need of a service with others that could offer a service working from home or working near the area they live.
